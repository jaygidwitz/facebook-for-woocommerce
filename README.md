### Logging

The plugin offers logging that can help debug various problems. You can enable debug mode in the main plugin settings
panel under the `Enable debug mode` section.
By default plugin omits headers in the requests to make the logs more readable. If debugging with headers is necessary
you can enable the headers in the logs by setting `wc_facebook_request_headers_in_debug_log` option to true.

#### Running E2E tests locally (events flow)

Use the helper script at `tests/e2e/scripts/run-local-events.sh`.

Before running it, export all required environment variables (the script reads values directly from your process environment):

```bash
export WORDPRESS_PATH="/absolute/path/to/wordpress"
export WORDPRESS_URL="http://your-local-site.test"

export WP_USERNAME="admin"
export WP_PASSWORD="admin"
export WP_CUSTOMER_USERNAME="customer"
export WP_CUSTOMER_PASSWORD="customer"

export TEST_PRODUCT_URL="${WORDPRESS_URL%/}/product/beanie/"
export TEST_CATEGORY_URL="${WORDPRESS_URL%/}/product-category/clothing/accessories/"
export TEST_FBCLID="IwAR123TestClickId456"

export FB_E2E_TEST_COOKIE_NAME="facebook_test_id"
export FB_E2E_LOGGER_PATH="/tests/e2e/helpers/php/event-logger.php"

export WP_DEBUG_LOG="${WORDPRESS_PATH}/wp-content/debug.log"
export WC_LOG_PATH="${WORDPRESS_PATH}/wp-content/uploads/wc-logs"
```

Then run:

```bash
./tests/e2e/scripts/run-local-events.sh
```

Optional flags:
